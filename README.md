Spell-e. The small visual game created using kivy python.
The directory contains all the files.
decompress and place all the files in one folder as shown in the "file structure.png".
Install required libraries and run main.py.

The build was easy to compile for ios compared to android.
worked well on iphone XR.
To compile for android had to install linux in VM and build. It failed few times. but eventually the build was success.
